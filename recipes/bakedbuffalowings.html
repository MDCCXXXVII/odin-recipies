    <h2> How to Make Baked Buffalo Wings In the Oven</h2>
    <img src="bakedbuffalowings1.png" alt="Baked Buffalo Wings from oven">
    <p> It's far easier than you think to make ultra-crispy Buffalo wings in the oven. All it takes is a few simple steps! You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> Combine flour, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and salt in a zip-top bag. Add the chicken wings, seal tightly, and shake to coat. Transfer the coated wings to a prepared baking sheet and refrigerate for an hour. Mix the hot sauce and butter in a bowl. Dip each wing in the sauce, then return them to the baking sheet. Bake, turning halfway through the bake time, until the chicken is fully cooked and the skin is crispy.</p>
    <h2> How Long to Bake Buffalo Wings</h2>
    <p> This recipe yields perfectly cooked chicken wings in about 45 minutes in an oven preheated to 400 degrees F. To test the chicken's doneness, insert an instant read thermometer into a meaty drumette (don't touch the bone). Chicken wings are ready-to-eat when the internal temperature reaches at least 165 degrees F.</p>
    <h2> What to Serve With Baked Buffalo Wings  </h2>
    <p>Traditionally, chicken wings are paired with a cooling dipping sauce (ranch and blue cheese are the most popular choices). Store-bought is fine, of course, but homemade is always better. It's also common to set out some crudites, such as sliced carrots and celery.

    If you're looking for a side dish to serve with a Buffalo wing entree, you might want to opt for something classic and crowd-pleasing — you can't go wrong with mac and cheese, French fries, or cornbread. For a lighter meal, try roasted veggies or a side salad.</p>
